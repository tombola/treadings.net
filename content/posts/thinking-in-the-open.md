I have a whole lot of projects that don't go anywhere, and some that do.

Like a lot of people I live a life of a hundred lists, most of which I never
look at. I also save items to reading later, most of which I don't read.

I sometimes find a way of thinking about something in the world that seems
useful, or epically profound in the moment, and then promptly forget it.

I have had a few false starts at blogs in the past, but I thought I might try
that again. This is only really an open letter to myself, but there is also a remote
chance someone else might find something relevant, or start a discussion, which
would be cool too.
